# Orbiting

Orbiting is a simple visual communication app for groups.

## This time HTML

This is the third time that we have built this app. The first couple times it was native iOS code. This time we have chosen a slightly more accessible route (we hope).

## Helping

Feel free to pick an issue, handle it and submit a pull request. 

## TODO

We have three milestones:

* [Launch](https://github.com/harperreed/orbiting/milestone/1)
* [Video and Drawing](https://github.com/harperreed/orbiting/milestone/2)
* [Group chat](https://github.com/harperreed/orbiting/milestone/3)

Let's get through the first one and then YAY

## Hosting / Tech

Orbiting is hosted at firebase and uses some plain javascript. It is pretty straight forward. 

We should use firebase functions to power group chat. 

## About

This is a collaboration initially between [Christine Sun Kim](http://asl.lol) and [Harper Reed](http://harperreed.com). 

The goal of the app is to create an amazingly simple way to communicate in a visual / chat way. Whether in groups or one on one - we want orbiting to be an easy and free way for people to interact together. 

### History

- v.04: you help us out to create an amazing app that is great!
- v.03: HTML/JS hack launched by Harper and CK at an MIT Medialab Berlin event summer 2018
- v.02: iOS app that worked much better. A really great team of [@nickttng](https://github.com/nickttng), [@sophiakc](https://github.com/sophiakc) and [@jovan90jovanovic](https://github.com/jovan90jovanovic) helped make the app awesome. However, it didn't stay up to date and we removed it from the app store.
- v.01: iOS app that barely worked
