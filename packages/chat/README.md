## ðŸ’¡ Summary of Project

Welcome to the **Chat App**! This application is built using the **Expo** framework for React Native, providing a seamless experience for capturing and managing text inputs in real-time. The app not only allows users to enter and edit text, but it also incorporates features to store messages, load them later, and clear history as needed. The main goal is to create an intuitive and efficient text management tool on mobile devices.
